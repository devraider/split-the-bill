# Split the Bill Application üí∞

## Motivation

The "Split the Bill" project is a ReactJS-based application designed to simplify the process of dividing expenses among friends or group members.

In this project, I deepened my understanding of several key React concepts, including:

- **Data Flow**: Mastering the flow of data through the application, and determining when to use global vs. local state based on the nature of the data.
- **Props Children**: Passing nested elements into components to enable dynamic content rendering.
- **Derived State**: Creating states that are derived from other existing states, ensuring efficient data handling.
- **Lifting State Up**: Moving state to a higher component to enable sharing of data between multiple child components.
- **Forms and Controlled Components**: Managing form inputs through controlled components, ensuring form data is consistently synced with state.
- **Props Destructuring**: Using destructuring to cleanly extract props in a more concise and readable manner.

It serves as a practical implementation to reinforce the knowledge gained from various React learning resources.

## Features ‚ú®

1. **ReactJS** - Utilizes React version 18.3 for building user interfaces.
2. **CSS Modules** - CSS Modules for component-scoped styling, ensuring modular and maintainable CSS.
3. **JavaScript (ES6)** - JavaScript features such as array methods, template literals, and destructuring for cleaner and more efficient code.
4. **Expense Management** - Allows users to add expenses, facilitating effective tracking of shared costs.
5. **Debt Calculation** - Automatically calculates the amount each person owes or is owed, simplifying the settlement of shared expenses.

## Component Structure üõ†Ô∏è

The application is structured with a focus on modularity and reusability. Components are organized to manage different aspects of the application, such as expense input, group listings, and debt summaries. This approach facilitates:

- **State Management** - Efficient handling of application state to reflect real-time data updates.
- **Conditional Rendering** - Dynamic display of content based on user interactions and application state.
- **Reusable Components** - Creation of generic components that can be utilized across different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and consistency.

## How to Get and Run the Application üõ†Ô∏è
